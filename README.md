Belly Button Bacteria Biodiversity Dashboard

This project used JavaScript, Plotly.JS, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. Data was read from CSV files using Pandas. Graphs were then created using Plotly and Javascript. The pie chart shows the top ten samples for a particular sample id. The bubble chart shows all the samples and OTU ID data points. Metadata for the sample is also displayed. The graphs resize when the page size is modified.

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
